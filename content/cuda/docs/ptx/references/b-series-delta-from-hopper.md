# B-Series Delta Index vs. Hopper

This page records the key PTX differences to focus on when migrating from Hopper (e.g., the `sm_90a` path) to the B-Series (`sm_100`/`sm_120`).

## Observed Difference Directions

- More instructions/modifiers are marked as available only under `sm_100+` in the documentation.
- `sm_120a` vs. `sm_120f` includes extra notes on certain types and qualifiers.
- TensorCore 5th Generation and related mixed/alternate-precision conditions are more common on the new-architecture paths.
- Asynchronous tensor movement and reduction paths (TMA / async bulk) include more architecture/type restriction entries.

## Migration Checklist

1. Check that `target` and compilation options match the intended target architecture.
2. Check whether any `sm_100+` threshold features are used (e.g., some cache/eviction/async proxy variants).
3. Check whether restricted types on `sm_120a` are triggered.
4. Perform minimal runnable regression tests for WGMMA / tcgen05 / TMA paths.
