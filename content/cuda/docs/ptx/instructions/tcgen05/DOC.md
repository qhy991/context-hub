# PTX tcgen05 (TensorCore 5th Generation)

This directory focuses on tcgen05 entry points and B-series architectural constraints, without duplicating the `wgmma` details already covered elsewhere.

## Core Positioning

- tcgen05 is the TensorCore 5th Generation entry point in the PTX documentation.
- It is tightly related to WGMMA, mixed/alternate precision, and new type qualifier constraints.
- Multiple capabilities in the documentation are bound to `sm_100`/`sm_120` family feature thresholds.
