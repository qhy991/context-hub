# tcgen05 Topic: Sparse MMA Paths

This page covers key points for tcgen05-related sparse MMA (`mma.sp`) across the `kind` / `block-scale` dimensions.

## Official Notes

- The sparse path introduces additional metadata/selectors operands.
- When combined with block scale, you still must satisfy valid combinations of `kind`/`stype`/`scale_vec_size`.
- The documentation specifies architectural requirements for alternate FP sparse paths.

## Engineering Guidance

- Build separate templates for sparse and dense paths to avoid cross-contaminating parameters.
- Perform boundary and consistency checks for metadata and selector parameters on the host side.
