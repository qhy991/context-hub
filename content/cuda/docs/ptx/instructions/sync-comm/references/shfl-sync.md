# PTX Instruction Topic: shfl.sync

`shfl.sync` exchanges register data within a warp and is commonly used for warp-level communication and reductions.

## Official Description

- Documentation section: Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: `shfl.sync`
- Commonly used for warp-level broadcast, down-scan, up-scan, and cross-lane exchange

## Key Constraints

- `membermask` must correctly describe the participating threads.
- lane indices and width parameters must follow the variant definition.
- Confirm that the target architecture supports this synchronized shuffle semantic before use.

## Example (PTX Style, Illustrative)

```ptx
shfl.sync.bfly.b32 r_out, r_in, laneMask, clamp, membermask;
```
