# PTX Instruction Topic: red

`red` is a parallel reduction-update instruction family: it performs an atomic reduction on a specified memory location and writes the result back to the same location (overwriting the original value).

## Official Description

- Documentation section: Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: `red`
- Compared with `atom`/`atom.*`, the core semantic of `red` is reduction write-back; whether an additional destination register exists/ is used depends on the specific variant syntax (see the corresponding ISA subsection).

## Key Constraints

- The operation type and the target address space must match the specific `red` variant.
- Concurrency semantics depend on the specified memory semantics and scope.
- It must be used together with consumer-side synchronization primitives to ensure visibility.

## Example (PTX Style)

```ptx
red.global.add.u32 [addr], r1;
```
