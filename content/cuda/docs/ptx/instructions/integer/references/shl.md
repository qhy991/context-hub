# PTX Instruction Topic: shl

`shl` is a left-shift instruction, used for bit extension and constructing high-bit alignment.

## Official Description

- Documentation section: Logic and Shift Instructions: `shl`

## Key Constraints

- The shift amount should be within the legal range for the bit width.
- For computations related to signed semantics, carefully verify overflow behavior.

## Example (PTX Style)

```ptx
shl.b32 d, a, b;
```
