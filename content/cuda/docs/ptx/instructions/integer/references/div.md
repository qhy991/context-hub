# PTX Instruction Topic: div

`div` performs division and supports different types and variant semantics.

## Official Description

- Documentation section: Integer Arithmetic Instructions: `div`

## Key Constraints

- The behavior when the divisor is 0 is defined by the official specification; protect against it before use.
- Signed/unsigned division semantics differ.
- On performance-critical paths, evaluate `div` latency and consider alternative strategies.

## Example (PTX Style)

```ptx
div.s32 d, a, b;
```
