# PTX Instruction Topic: brev

`brev` performs a bit reverse and is commonly used for bit-manipulation rearrangement and index transformations.

## Official Description

- Documentation section: Logic and Shift Instructions: `brev`
- Commonly used in scenarios that require bit-level reversed mappings

## Key Constraints

- The input/output bit widths must match the instruction variant.
- It only changes bit ordering; it does not extend arithmetic semantics.

## Example (PTX Style)

```ptx
brev.b32 d, a;
```
