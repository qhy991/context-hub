# PTX Instruction Topic: wgmma.wait_group

`wgmma.wait_group` waits for the wgmma-group to complete and is a necessary step before reading the results of `wgmma.mma_async`.

## Official Syntax

```ptx
wgmma.wait_group.sync.aligned N;
```

## Key Semantics

- Wait until the number of the most recent pending groups does not exceed `N`, and earlier groups have completed.
- `N=0` means waiting for all previously submitted groups to complete.
- The documentation states that if you access the accumulator / related input registers without waiting for the group that contains the target `wgmma.mma_async`, the behavior is undefined.
- `.sync` and `.aligned` have the same execution-consistency requirements as `commit_group`.
