# PTX Instruction Topic: wgmma.fence

`wgmma.fence` is used to constrain the ordering boundary of register accesses related to `wgmma.mma_async`.

## Official Key Semantics

- The documentation explicitly states that you must use `wgmma.fence` before `wgmma.mma_async` to isolate the related register accesses; otherwise behavior is undefined.
- It is typically combined with `wgmma.commit_group` / `wgmma.wait_group` to form a complete execution protocol.

## Usage Patterns (Illustrative)

```ptx
wgmma.fence.sync.aligned;
wgmma.mma_async.sync.aligned ...;
wgmma.commit_group.sync.aligned;
wgmma.wait_group.sync.aligned 0;
```
