# PTX Instruction Topic: %tid and %ctaid

`%tid` and `%ctaid` are the most commonly used index registers. They represent a thread's position within a CTA and the CTA's position within the grid, respectively.

## Typical Usage

```ptx
mov.u32 r_tid, %tid.x;
mov.u32 r_cta, %ctaid.x;
```

## Usage Notes

- `%tid` / `%ctaid` are read-only special registers.
- The dimension components (`.x/.y/.z`) must match how the kernel is organized.
