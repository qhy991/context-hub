# PTX Instruction Topic: brx.idx

`brx.idx` is an index-based branch control flow instruction, commonly used for jump-table-style dispatch.

## Official Description

- Documentation section: Control Flow Instructions: `brx.idx`
- Used to select the branch target based on an index value

## Key Constraints

- The index range must match the number of valid table entries.
- The strategy for handling invalid indices should be clearly defined in higher-level logic.
- Conditional paths must keep warp-level control-flow consistency manageable.

## Example (PTX Style, Illustrative)

```ptx
brx.idx idx, table;
```
